# Uses firebase firestore (for realtime sync of chats directly with frontend)
## Tried to make chat as portable as possible, sorry for garbage code :P (at least i tried to be as neat as possible)
Features:
1. Unlimited users could chat in room by simply creating a room and joining it via shareable link
2. Dark interface
------------------------------
## Confession:
Should have used google oauth2 for entering into rooms instead an alert prompt asking name :/
